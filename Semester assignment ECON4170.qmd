## introduction

this is a semester project where we will be making a model to see if we can predict the price of electricity in Norway, one day (24 hours) ahead of time. we want to create a model that beats the naive benchmark.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed)
